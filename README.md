### Star Wars Survey

#### In this project, I explore how people ranked the Star Wars Movies episode I - VI.  
#### Survey data is taken from FiveThirtyEight's repo here https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data.

#### The first part of project shows how I cleaned the data, while the second part shows the analysis itself. 

#### I'm interested to see if people liked the original Star Wars movies more. Thus far, I have explored how rankings 
#### differ by gender and whether one consider himself/herself as a Star Wars or Star Trek fan. 

#### Next is to explore the data by location, education and which characters do people like the most.
